      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      Pure Component Definition
    </h1>
    <p>
      Based on the concept of purity in functional programming paradigms, a function is said to be pure if it meets the following two conditions:

<li>Its return value is only determined by its input values</li>
<li>Its return value is always the same for the same input values</li>
A React component is considered pure if it renders the same output for the same state and props. For this type of class component, React provides the PureComponent base class.
 Class components that extend the React.PureComponent class are treated as pure components

      High Order Component Definition

    </h1>
    <p>
      A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. 
      HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.
      Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
